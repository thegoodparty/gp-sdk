# Use Library Features Before Rolling Your Own

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
- Before implementing ANY functionality, FIRST check whether the libraries already in use provide that capability.
- Read the library's documentation AND inspect its type definitions to discover available options.
- NEVER manually implement something a library already handles.

EXAMPLES OF VIOLATIONS:
- Manually building query strings when the HTTP library has a `query`/`params` option
- Manually stringifying JSON when the HTTP library auto-serializes objects
- Manually parsing responses when the library handles content-type detection
- Manually joining URL paths when the library has a `baseURL` option
- Building custom retry logic when the library has built-in retry support

REQUIRED WORKFLOW:
1. Identify what you need to do (e.g., add query params to a request)
2. Check the library's type definitions for relevant options
3. Check the library's documentation for the feature
4. Use the library's built-in solution
5. Only implement custom logic if the library genuinely does not support the use case

This rule applies to ALL libraries, not just HTTP clients.
